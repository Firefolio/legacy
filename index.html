                There are a couple of reasons why you might be seeing this:
              </h2>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>The site owner's web root is configured incorrectly</b>
                  <p>
                    Firefolio is configured to be secure by default. As such,
                    the bits and pieces that make it work are seperated out from
                    the things you need to see the end result, so:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Please tell them (or yourself) that any site using
                      Firefolio should point to the <code>public_html</code>
                      folder, and not the <code>firefolio-x.x.x</code> folder
                      included in the download.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you can, ask them to
                      <a href="documentation">
                        read the documentation
                      </a>
                      in case they get stuck.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>A 'bad actor' has compromised the site/server</b>
                  <p>
                    This is unlikely, but totally possible that a weak point has
                    allowed someone to do bad things behind the scenes.
                    In which case:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Contact the host.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Contact the developer.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        You should only do this if this message didn't show up
                        before.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If you think you know what's wrong, tell them.
                      </li>
