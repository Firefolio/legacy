Tutorial Introduction
=====================

Firefolio was designed to be as simple and straightforward to use as possible,
but sometimes it's nice to be properly introduced. As such, I've included this
tutorial to make you aware of Firefolio's basic functionality, so that you can
go on to build the best portfolio you can with it.

It makes the following assumptions:

* You already have a publically available web server with Firefolio installed
* You have some knowledge of content management software, web browsers and
  computers in general

It shouldn't take too long to read and should help you a lot in the long run.
Without further ado, let's begin!
