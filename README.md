An Online Portfolio System for Professional Programmers

![Firefolio](firefolio.png)

## About
**Firefolio** is a self-hosted web application designed to help programmers
showcase their work to employers. It's like a content managament system, but
focused eniterly on creating a single kind of website.

## Requirements
- PHP v`7.0.0` or greater
- A web server to host the files on
- A relational database such as MySQL or MariaDB connected to the server

[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) is the recommended software for
developing **Firefolio**. It's a web server that runs locally on your computer
and meets all of the above requirements.

## History
**Firefolio** was originally a prototype called [Blue Carbon](https://github.com/blue-carbon)
which was made as part of a university assignment in web design. After being
dissatisfied with it's performance and myriad of design quirks,
I decided to rebuild the entire thing from scratch in order for it to be more
accessible to a wider audience outside of myself.
